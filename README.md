# F1 Classification System

This is my final assignement for Programming Languages 1 course at TAMK. 
This Java-based project is a race management system for Formula 1. It includes functionalities to manage races, track driver standings and constructor standings.

## Quick guide to F1 points system
|**Positon**|**Points**|
| ------------- |:-------------:|
|1|25|
|2|18|
|3|15|
|4|12|
|5|10|
|6|8|
|7|6|
|8|4|
|9|2|
|10|1|

Additionally, if a driver classified 10th or above sets the fastest lap during the race, an additional point is awarded to the driver.

## Project Structure
